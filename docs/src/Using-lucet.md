# Using Lucet

To get started using Lucet, you will need to either set up the provided [Docker-based development
environment](./Docker-based-development.md), or [compile Lucet from scratch](./Compiling.md).

Once the Lucet command-line tools are available, you can [run a Lucet "Hello World"
application](./Your-first-Lucet-application.md), or use the [`lucet-runtime`
API](./lucet-runtime-example.md) to embed a Lucet program in your Rust application.
