# `lucet-spectest`

`lucet-spectest` is a Rust crate that uses `lucetc` and `lucet-runtime`, as well as the (external)
`wabt` crate, to run the official WebAssembly spec test suite, which is provided as a submodule in
this directory.

Lucet is not yet fully spec compliant, however reaching spec compliance is part of our project
roadmap.
